## Formation Stages
Formative training is the conscious assistance and guidance given by the MMT- especially during the Novitiate and in the early years of each member’s admission. The member must cooperate earnestly in his own formation by his attentive response to the action of the holy spirit, by his efforts and willingness to learn and by engaging in frank dialogue with the Formators and the Community (CF/ CC 646, 652, 1-4). </p>
The training of our members involves five distinct and yet interrelated stages of formation:
1. Aspirancy

2. Postulancy/Seminary training (Philosophate)

3. Novitiate/Temporary Profession

4. Scholasticate (Theologiate)/ Final Profession

5. Pastoral Year (ongoing formation or Internship) – Diaconate and Priesthood.
