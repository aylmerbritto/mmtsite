## WHO ARE THE MMT MISSIONARIES

HISTORY AND LIFE OF MISSIONARIES OF MOTHER TERESA OF CALCUTTA IN AFRICA

The Missionaries of Mother Teresa of Calcutta began in Africa on 5th day of September 2003, feast of St. Mother Teresa of Calcutta (Religious) by Rev Fr. Faustyn MC and Rev Nnadi Jude Felix Chetachukwu MMT. 5th of September is chosen as our Foundation Day. Two priests and few rev sisters were present with four young men as the candidates together with us at a brief prayer ceremony to mark this beginning, in Owerri at Nigerian Red Cross society at the home for the motherless babies Warehouse Owerri Imo state Nigeria Africa. It so happened by coincidence or Divine plan that we met these two priests with the few sisters when we went with four young men to visit the motherless babies. 

The Brothers were originally under the guidance of the Claretians Institute of Philosophy where they are studying philosophy as lay students who agreed willingly to do the work of charity. During this time, we were waiting for someone suitable to take up the leadership of the Brothers. In 2017 we met with priests who supported the mission with their prayers and donations: Rev Fr. Prof. Anthony Onyecha, from Owerri Archdiocese and Rev Fr Stephen Nadakuzhackal from India working in Tanzania and Rev. Fr. Ebenizer Okoro CMF, they had a special desire to work with the poor and to help us grow the congregation. Seeing their attraction to the vocation of the Brothers, we saw them as the answer to our prayers and took them as the spiritual directors of the congregation as we continue to look for Episcopal blessings and approval from the bishops. In this process, one of our founder Rev Fr. Faustyn, a polish Missionaries of Charity Priest, who was doing Mission in Africa, it is He who helped us to get an approval from the Archbishop of Poland, Most Rev Dr. Tadeuz Wojda, our principal Bishop. We are currently working in Nigeria Where our Generalate is and  India, Philippines etc. 

### OUR MOTTO

`DO SMALL THINGS WITH GREAT LOVE`

### OUR CHARISM

`A PROPHETIC MISSIONARY ROOTED IN CHARITY AND SACRIFICE FOR THIRSTING JESUS IN THE POOR`

WHO ARE WE, OUR SPIRITUALITY AND APOSTOLATE?

We are a community of Priest and brothers in the family of MISSIONARIES OF MOTHER TERESA OF CALCUTTA, called by our Lord Jesus to devote our self especially to prayer, penance and whole hearted free service to the  poorest of the poor and more especially taking Jesus in the Holy Eucharist to the prisoners, staying with them, playing, praying with them and cerebrating Holy Mass everyday with them as well as sharing in their pains, sorrows, and sufferings. 

### OUR VOCATION:

Our vocation as missionaries of Mother Teresa Calcutta is to be ORDAINED and LAY (NON ORDAINED) ministers of the church in the heart of the world, that is to be closely in touch with realities of modern day life especially in so far as the poor, marginalized, and the weak in our society are concerned. While remaining intimately in communion with Jesus in prayers and in the Holy Eucharist, our life is essentially a life of silent prayers apostolic and missionary, a life in which charity and mercy underlines all our activities. Our life is characterized by a great emphasis on prayers, penance, works of mercy and being with the prisoners/motherless babies as true basic of all spiritual and material activities. The missionaries of Mother Teresa of Calcutta believe in developing the whole man, body and soul to make him the soldier of Christ which he is called to be.

## THE FOUR ESSENTIALS OF OUR VOCATION

Prayer– is of great importance to us, to seek oneness with God in silent contemplation, in personal prayer and in common prayer. We spend several hours each day in various types of prayer with the Eucharist at the centre, devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, the cause of our joy and the mother of all graces. We also make prayers to St. Maximilian Kolbe our patron saint.

Community life- we need each other and rejoice in our companionship as brothers and disciples. If we are to become men of love, the give and take of community life will help us to come to know and accept ourselves and others. The love we learn in community life will overflow in service to the poor and the prisoners.

Work with the poorest– we approach our work not as a job but as part of our relationship with the Lord. In serving the needy, not only do we have the opportunity to treat others as we would like them to treat us, but even more, to do to the poor what you would like to be able to do for Jesus. (Mother Teresa)

Simplicity -of life we try to show our love for the prisoners and all the world suffering people by sharing in their poverty, by been content with the basic necessities of life. We want to be one with our people as much as possible; entrusting our needs to God. We extend this simplicity to our way of working, praying and studying.

### OUR BENEFITS

Missionaries of mother Teresa of Calcutta have the opportunity to encounter Christ in his suffering. There are numerous benefits in designating suffering and prayer to the MMT. Members grow in holiness through spiritually assisting other missionaries in their work to expand the kingdom of God here on Earth and to make the works of the missionaries of mother Teresa of Calcutta more fruitful. They are comforted in their sufferings knowing that their sacrifices are being converted into instruments for saving souls throughout the world.

According to St John Paul II, “To share in the suffering of Christ is at the same time, to suffer for the kingdom sufferings of Christ becomes worthy of the kingdom. Christ, through his own savitie suffering is very much present in every human suffering and can act from within that suffering by the power of his spirit of truth, his consoling spirit”.

Salvific Doloris. On the meaning of human suffering John Paul II, 1984.

OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE: BEING SET APART

The first duty of being part of us is “Sanctity” that is to become a saint. By professing the four vows of poverty, chastity, obedience and free service to the poorest of the poor, we are set apart, consecrated body and soul, to be exclusively for God. By being faithful to those vows, a missionary of mother Teresa becomes a sign of what it will be like in heaven, when we hold the beatific vision.

## WHAT WE PROFESS

As Missionaries of Mother Teresa of Calcutta we profess four vows.

By poverty, we proclaim and witness that we want to love God above all things, to have Him for our wealth and security.

By chastity, we proclaim that we want to love Him above all other persons, seeking our fulfillment and fruition in our commitment to Him in celibate love.

By obedience, we proclaim that it is our desire to love God above our own will, transcending ourselves in Him who is our freedom and our destiny.

Our fourth vow of “whole-hearted free service to the poorest of the poor and prisoners binds us to Christ in His own mission.

## OUR HABIT

Our postulant brothers wear ordinary clothes [black and white] with a crucifix on the left side over the chest.  

Our novices wear white hood with black trouser and the Immaculata Medal

Our brothers are professed with the Roman collar, after which the wear black/White cassock with blue sash and rosary. [As a sign of our profession] The blue sash and rosary is symbolic, that which unities us with the blessed Mother “THE IMMACULATA” And the white/black cassock is a sign of PURITY and reminds us of the passion of Christ.

Our finally professed wear blue capuche and white scapular.

## OUR DAILY PROGRAM

Our daily program of community prayer as the members of missionaries of Mother Teresa OF Calcutta include Holy mass celebrated in all our communities and schools where our brothers are. At least one hour of Eucharist adoration, the liturgy of the hour of which we always sing the lauds and the vespers. We also have the opportunity for a day of profound prayer in complete silence and solitude once every week(Thursdays). Penance also plays a special part in our life in order to make reparation for our sins and that of the whole world. Apart from periods of prescribed recreation, we also observe a spirit of silence and prayer fullness, which helps each brother to intimately and personally commune with God.

## OUR SPIRIRTUALITY
The Holy Cross and the Holy Eucharist is the greatest revelation of God’s Divine nature. There is nothing one can do, say or preach that will reveal more about God than the Holy Cross and Holy Eucharist. Nothing will affect one more, or change him as dramatically as witnessing the Holy Cross. That is why as a member of the MMT. Missionaries, we meditate daily on the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ and see it many times.

Our Spirituality is based on the three nails by which we are joined to the Holy Cross which we have freely chosen and which God has chosen for us. These nails are ;

1.In the Holy Eucharist we find the centre of our life, the spiritual food that nourishes and sustains us.

2.As MMT. Missionaries, we cherish a deep devotion to our Lady, whom we honor particularly under the title” CAUSE OF OUR JOY”.

3.The poorest of the poor and the prisoners are all around us, before we can see them, we come to discover our material and spiritual poverty in front of our Lord Jesus Christ who made Himself poor to the point of annihilation, hidden under the form of simple Bread {the Holy Eucharist} .

## OUR APOSTOLATE

According to Mother Teresa of Calcutta, we respond to Jesus, who, dying on the Cross carried out I THIRST, I thirst is something much deeper than just saying “I love you”. Humanly, His body cried out in physical pain for the most basic human need. Spiritually, He was thirsting for the love and salvation of every human person. We see our aim as seeking to quench this thirst of Jesus; His thirst for the salvation of all, and His thirst within each person for the fullness of life and love on apostolate is basically.

HOLY SACRAMENTAL SERVICE IN THE PRISON: The primary work or apostolate of the Missionaries of Mother Teresa of Calcutta is holy sacramental service especially to those in the prisons. People in prisons are still people made in the image and likeness of God. No matter what they have done, they deserve the opportunity to hear the word of God and find the truth of the message of Christ. We see our aim as to take Jesus in the holy Eucharist to the prisoners and also give them bread (food). We give holy sacramental service to the prisoners.
MISSIONARY PREACHING : Another (most) important work or apostolate of the missionaries of Mother Teresa of Calcutta is working in parishes and preaching Retreats. At the request of a Priest or Bishop, a priest is sent from our congregation to preach the truths of our faith in Love, Mercy and Charity. One of the main goals of Preaching parish missions is conversion, especially found in the sacramental of confession.
MERCY HOUSES: (CHARITABLE HOMES): We also work in charitable houses, we open homes where the less privilege can find hope and feel loved. Visiting the poor in the street, hospital and old people’s homes (both homes for old priests an Lay people) giving shelter to the homeless people and orphanages, and physically and mentally challenged people are also part of our apostolate.
