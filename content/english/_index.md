Nandi Jude Felix Chetachukwu MMT from Nigeria, in September 5, 2003 on the feast day of Saint Mother Teresa. Through the help of the Holy Spirit, it was approved and erected as a Public Association of Christ’s Faithful in the year 2017 by Most Rev Dr. Tadeuz Wojda S.A.C, Archbishop of Bialystok. The MMT is under the leadership of  Very Rev Fr. Dr.  Prof. Anthony Onyecho (Arch-Diocese of Owerri) the Director General. Along with his assistants on the General Council.
